### State

State is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. From the outside, it appears as if the object's class has changed.

## Key Concepts:

* State encapsulation → each state is implemented as a separate class that defines specific behavior

* Dynamic behavior change → the object delegates actions to the current state, which can be changed at runtime

* Simplified conditional logic → replaces complex if/switch statements with cleaner, more scalable code

State complicates the initial architecture but provides high flexibility in behavior management and simplifies system extension.
