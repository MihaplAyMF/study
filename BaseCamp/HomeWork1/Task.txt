Ubuntu installation to virtual machine

Description of the homework: Ubuntu Linux installation to the Virtual Box VM, configure host-only network and organize network connection between the main PC and VM.

Add new group “testgroup1” with GID 1234

Add new group “testgroup2” with GID 4321

Add new user “testuser” with UID 1234, Shell: /bin/bash, primary group = “testgroup1”, create homedir automatically.

Add new user “testuser2” with UID 4321, Shell: /bin/bash, primary group = “testgroup2”, create homedir automatically.

Rename “testuser” to “testuser1”

Modify “testuser1” directory to be the same as username.

Expected result:   Ubuntu Linux is installed on the Virtual Box VM, the host-only network is configured, and a network connection is established between the host PC and VM.

testgroup1 is created with GID 1234

testgroup2 is created with GID 4321

testuser is created with UID 1234, Shell: /bin/bash, primary group = “testgroup1” and home directory: /home/testuser.

testuser2 is created with UID 4321, Shell: /bin/bash, primary group = “testgroup2” and home directory: /home/testuser2.

“testuser” is renamed to “testuser1”

“testuser1” home directory is renamed to “/home/testuser1”
